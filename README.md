## Introduction  

Achieving the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certification is no small feat. It requires a deep understanding of AWS services, extensive hands-on experience, and strategic preparation. My journey to certification spanned over 1.5 years, during which I independently learned, practiced, and applied AWS solutions to real-world projects through self-learning and university assignments. This document outlines my path to success, showcasing the resources, challenges, and valuable lessons learned along the way.
AWS is shaping the future of technology, and its dominance in the cloud industry is undeniable. From startups to enterprises, businesses are leveraging AWS to drive innovation and efficiency. This journey has taught me that no dream is too big if you remain dedicated and focused. I hope my experience motivates others to take on challenges, explore new horizons, and trust in their ability to achieve great things. With AWS continuing to rule the technological landscape, now is the perfect time to embark on this exciting path.

## My Cloud Computing Journey  

My introduction to cloud computing began during my **first summer internship** at **Pakistan Broadcast Corporation HQ**, where I received **AWS Basic Training**. The training covered core AWS services, including:  

- **EC2**: Virtual servers in the cloud.  
- **S3**: Scalable object storage.  
- **SQS**: Managed message queues.  
- **Lambda**: Serverless computing.  
- **Datasync**: Service for data transfer and ongoing replication.  

The organization’s use of AWS to deploy datasets and manage storage inspired me to explore cloud computing further. I found AWS more convenient than traditional on-premises setups due to its scalability and flexibility.  

Post-internship, I began **self-learning AWS** through Coursera and Udemy courses, focusing on practical applications by deploying real projects. Over **1.5 years**, I worked on:  

- Building a **portfolio website** hosted on AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB).
- Engaging in hands-on labs, which are available on my GitHub repo. If you're interested in practicing, feel free to follow that series.
- Experimenting with **microservices architecture**.  

These hands-on experiences made me proficient in AWS, but I realized passing the certification exam required dedicated exam-focused preparation.

## Exam Day Experience  

The exam day was both challenging and rewarding. While I felt prepared due to extensive practice and hands-on experience, I made the mistake of not sleeping well before the exam. Here’s a summary:  

- **Preparation**: I felt confident about my knowledge and practice.  
- **Challenges**: Sleep deprivation impacted my focus, requiring me to read questions multiple times.  
- **Score**: I scored **771/1000**, but I believe a good night’s sleep would have improved my performance.  

**Lesson Learned**: Rest is just as important as preparation. Ensure you get **7–8 hours of sleep** before the exam and **stay calm**.

## Future Plans  

If you're passionate about cloud computing, combining certifications with real-world experience is the key to excelling in this field. Pursuing advanced certifications like the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional and gaining hands-on experience in AWS-related job settings will help you tackle real-world challenges and build expertise.

Explore the AWS Marketplace to understand how businesses leverage AWS services with third-party solutions, and participate in events like AWS re:Invent to network, learn from experts, and stay updated on the latest innovations. Certifications validate your knowledge, but applying it in real-world scenarios truly sets you apart.

That's exactly what my future plan is—combining certifications with hands-on experience, exploring the AWS Marketplace, and engaging with the cloud community to continually grow and stay ahead in this dynamic field.

## Important Note for Pakistani Aspirants

Scheduling your AWS certification exam in Pakistan with a Pakistani credit/debit card is not possible, as Pearson has blacklisted Pakistan for unknown reasons. However, you have two options:

1. You can **purchase an exam voucher** from a trusted voucher site like [AWS Exam Voucher](https://market.xvoucher.com/aws-ec/home) and use it to schedule your exam.

2. Alternatively, you can **contact an exam test center** in your area to book the exam on your behalf. You will need to pay them directly for the exam booking.

Make sure to plan ahead and allow some time for this process when scheduling your exam.
